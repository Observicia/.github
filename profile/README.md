# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction 

Observicia is designed to gain insights into LLM based Applications's health and performance through an easy to use Observability SDK.

Observicia combines the power of observability ("Observ") with the perceptive capabilities of AI ("ic" from "i see") and "ia", a mirror image of "AI", 
representing the reflective nature of the framework.
